# This is the EmulatorController class
# upstream supports the AWSClientController, although hasn't publicly released the implementation
# We will implement a platform-agnostic controller as the Red team doesn't require any platform-specific
# functionality, and can interact with any specific platform implementation (client, virtual, bare-metal)
